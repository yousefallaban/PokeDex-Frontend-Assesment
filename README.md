# Assessment

## Installation & run

- Download and install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) _(.NET 6.0 and higher recommended)_
- Open a terminal in `src/PokedexAPI`
- Run `dotnet run`
- Visit [`http://localhost:5000/swagger`](http://localhost:5000/swagger) to see the API documentation
- Create your frontend in the folder `src/frontend`

## Assessment

Use the REST API to show the Pokémon on a web page. You must be able to "catch" the Pokémon for your own Pokédex.  
You're allowed to use any frontend framework/library/technology for this. Feel free to use what you are most comfortable with.  
We expect that you’ll need about 2 to 5 hours for the assessment. If you're running out of time, let us know what you wanted to do, but didn't have time for.

**Notes:**

- Please do not use a code generator like Yeoman, or starter repositories containing an empty app.
  - _Using framework-provided tooling like the Angular/Vue CLI and create-react-app is fine_
- Use your own creativity for the styling of the application.

**We evaluate the solution on:**

- The overall approach you took to the assignment
- Your solution for the use case
- The architecture of the solution and the technologies used
- Quality of the code
- Tests for critical functionality

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.

Good luck with the assignment!
